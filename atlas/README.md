# readouts: how it works

Mapped at 2026-10-01 from commit 85e5452 by Atlas 1.24.0.

## What this is

20 parts, mostly Python (161 files), HTML (57), Rust (6), JavaScript (3), CSS (2), TypeScript (2) and Astro (1). Work enters through 2 doors; verify and Deploy site to GitHub Pages each reach 2 parts, and verify is followed because a pull request goes through it. It deploys a site to GitHub Pages.

## What changed since the last map

This is the first map.

## What comes in

1. **verify.** On a pull request touching 6 paths; on a push to main touching 6 paths; or by hand. Runs verify.py.
2. **Deploy site to GitHub Pages.** On a push to main touching 3 paths; or by hand. Runs site/astro.config.mjs and site/src/.

## What happens through verify

1. The workflow runs verify.py in the repository root.
2. That reaches shared (1 file).

## Who reads the results

verify writes nothing this map can see.

## The other doors

**Deploy site to GitHub Pages** runs site/astro.config.mjs and site/src/, reaches the repository root, and deploys the site.

## What breaks what

- **shared** is imported by 6 parts (blender-knowledge, godot-knowledge, the repository root, rust-knowledge, sprite-motion-knowledge, sprites-knowledge) and sits on the path of 1 door.
- **the repository root** is imported by 1 part (the site) and sits on the path of 2 doors.
- **index.html** is written by shared and read by model-knowledge, tensor-engine-knowledge, training-knowledge and xrpl-knowledge; a hand edit reaches every reader.
- **.claude/loadout/index.json** is written by shared and read by blender-knowledge, godot-knowledge, model-knowledge, the repository root, rust-knowledge, shared, sprite-motion-knowledge, sprites-knowledge, tensor-engine-knowledge, training-knowledge and xrpl-knowledge; a hand edit reaches every reader.

## What tends to change together

No two source files changed together often enough to name.

Window: 180 days; a pair counts from 3 shared commits, since the window holds fewer than 30 qualifying commits.

## What no test touches

- **oracle** is imported by no test.
- **oracle-jam** is imported by no test.
- **oracle-jam-strict** is imported by no test.
- **shared** is imported by no test.
- **tensor-engine-knowledge** is imported by no test.

tensor-engine-knowledge/baselines/_triton_test.py runs in no workflow.

## Written but never read

- **blender-knowledge/.claude/loadout/index.json** is written by blender-knowledge/scripts/gen_loadout.py and read by nothing else in this repository.
- **blender-knowledge/blender.db** is written by blender-knowledge (4 files) and read by nothing else in this repository.
- **docker-knowledge/.claude/loadout/index.json** is written by docker-knowledge/scripts/gen_loadout.py and read by nothing else in this repository.
- **docker-knowledge/findings.db** is written by docker-knowledge (4 files) and read by nothing else in this repository.
- **docker-knowledge/waves/wave-02-measurement/research-raw.json** is written by docker-knowledge/waves/wave-02-measurement/_build_raw.py and read by nothing else in this repository.
- **docker-knowledge/waves/wave-03-pinned-memory/research-raw.json** is written by docker-knowledge/waves/wave-03-pinned-memory/_build_raw.py and read by nothing else in this repository.
- **godot-knowledge/.claude/loadout/index.json** is written by godot-knowledge/scripts/gen_loadout.py and read by nothing else in this repository.
- **godot-knowledge/godot.db** is written by godot-knowledge (4 files) and read by nothing else in this repository.

And 37 more places.

## Helpers that look duplicated

These are candidates from names and call order, not a judgement.

- **already_done** is exported by sprite-motion-knowledge/scripts/verify_cloud.py (sprite-motion-knowledge) and xrpl-knowledge/scripts/verify_cloud.py (xrpl-knowledge); the two look alike.
- **b** is exported by 5 parts (blender-knowledge, godot-knowledge, sprite-motion-knowledge, sprites-knowledge and training-knowledge); with the same name in this many parts it is most likely a shared contract, not a copy.
- **call_model** is exported by 3 parts (blender-knowledge, sprite-motion-knowledge and xrpl-knowledge); with the same name in this many parts it is most likely a shared contract, not a copy.
- **cell** is exported by 11 parts (blender-knowledge, docker-knowledge, godot-knowledge, model-knowledge, rust-knowledge and 6 more); with the same name in this many parts it is most likely a shared contract, not a copy.
- **est** is exported by 11 parts (blender-knowledge, docker-knowledge, godot-knowledge, model-knowledge, rust-knowledge and 6 more); with the same name in this many parts it is most likely a shared contract, not a copy.

And 15 more candidates.

## Hand-authored

People write .github/, docs/ and site/; 31 writes with paths built at run time may land here.

- **docker-knowledge/waves/wave-02-measurement/research-raw.json** is written by docker-knowledge/waves/wave-02-measurement/_build_raw.py from inputs this repository does not keep, and by people.
- **rust-knowledge/waves/wave-04-si-jam-sessions/** is written by rust-knowledge/scripts/openrouter_lane.py from inputs this repository does not keep, and by people.

## Where to start

.github/workflows/verify.yml → verify.py → shared/verdicts.py

Read those in order to follow one pull request end to end.

## What this map cannot see

- 16 imports could not be resolved: `rust-knowledge/waves/wave-03-si-rpg-engine/probes/globals_probe.rs` imports `wasmparser::ExternalKind`; `rust-knowledge/waves/wave-03-si-rpg-engine/probes/globals_probe.rs` imports `wasmparser::Operator`; `rust-knowledge/waves/wave-03-si-rpg-engine/probes/globals_probe.rs` imports `wasmparser::Parser`; and 13 more.
- 1 import site names a path outside this repository, so what it loads is not followed.
- 31 writes and 29 reads use paths built at run time and are not named here.
- 10 writes go to places this repository does not track, so they are not listed as generated.
- 23 writes and 61 reads go to a path their caller passes, not to this repository.
- 6 writes and 2 reads go to a temporary directory, not to this repository.
- 3 reads go to the directory the command is run in, not to this repository.
- 1 read goes to the home directory (.cargo/), not to this repository.
- Statistics confidence is low: fewer than 30 qualifying commits in the window, and fewer than 20 source files reach 10 revisions.
